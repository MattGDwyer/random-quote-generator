<!-- what is the fastest way to do this?
If I'm gonna test this locally, I need to 
setup:
  install jquery using npm
  copy over server js
  modify server js for file tree
  figure out how to make a package json and package lock json
  create a gitignore file
  make sure necessary files are hidden
  do i need to install node?
  what does npm install do again?
  npm start?
  fuck there's a lot to that, but its the way I want to do it.
  more deployed more better. Fuck yes, back to work
  test it running locally how? node localhost:3000
design:
  only a container in index, and nothing else.
  identify bootstrap and sass shit to use
  what would i put in styles.css? Anything? Probably not
  bootstrap for responsivity
    but what exactly?
    look up bootstrap docs
  Am i just going to copy a database of quotes?
    yes
  setup jquery function to build each entry
    use sass/bootstrap to separate styling from jquery bs.
  design animation
